        <p class="desc">
            Marian University is called to boldly serve the world by providing an education that transforms the hearts and minds of students through the integration of<br> knowledge and faith. As a Catholic Franciscan university we welcome all to join in this mission as students, staff, faculty, alumni, and friends.<br>
            <br>
            Our foundresses, the Sisters of Saint Francis (Oldenburg, IN), were ambassadors of Christ who walked by faith and whose courage to venture made our<br> great university possible. Today, this Gospel work is carried on in new ways by those who represent many faith systems and ideologies through excellent<br> teaching, individualized mentoring, and academically-rigorous research. At Marian University students receive an education that empowers them as leaders<br> to promote the Franciscan Sponsorship Values rooted in prayer: the dignity of the individual, reconciliation, peace, and justice, and responsible<br> stewardship.

        <p class="desc-title">Aspects of a Great Catholic University</p>
        <p class="desc">Marian University, the only Catholic university in central Indiana, traces its roots eight hundred years to the first Catholic universities and is grounded in its<br> Franciscan heritage. This tradition enables Marian University to provide the life-changing opportunity of education to students of every race, faith, ideology,<br> gender, and economic status in order to promote human progress. As Saint John Paul II stated when writing about higher education, "A Catholic University,<br> as any University, is immersed in human society; as an extension of its service to the Church and always within its proper competence, it is called on to<br> become an ever more effective instrument of cultural progress for individuals as well as for society." We dare to say each Marian University student will<br> experience the following aspects of a great Catholic university:</p>
